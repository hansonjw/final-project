UCB Boot Camp - Final Project

# Project Requirements
​
* Use React for the front end.
* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:
	* Uses a web manifest
	* Uses a service worker for offline functionality
	* Is installable
* Have a polished UI.
* Be responsive.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Include authentication (JWT).
* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
​
Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 20.
You should also consider the following suggestions to help your project stand out:
​
## CSS Styling
​
Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:
​
* Look into the concept of **CSS-in-JS**, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).
* Try using a component library, such as [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).
* Create all the CSS for your application just using CSS.
Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose&mdash;it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.
​
## Payment Platform
​
Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

**More details about the project will be provided in the lessons for Module 23 in Canvas.**


Other Considerations:
Also, re the requirements and JWT: I would prefer if you used JWT’s in the context of evaluating someone else’s JWTs and not rolling your own for authentication.  In my long-winded lecture last Monday, I tried to explain why JWTs are not often a great solution for implementing authentication in your application, but they are a great way for you to implement someone else’s authentication in your app.  For example, a great way to implement a login portal in your app would be by using Google Sign On: you will have to read their documentation and struggle through their website instructions (https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth).
BONUS CHALLENGE: benchmark using JWTs for authentication in your app vs. a simple session-based login (e.g. via a session identifier) for your authentication.  Which is faster?  Which requires more bandwidth?  How would you test this?




## Presentation Requirements
Your group will give a 10-minute presentation on your project, with about 7 minutes devoted to the presentation itself, followed by a 3-minute Question & Answer session. Use this Project Presentation Template (Links to an external site.) to address the following:

* Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.
* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
* Process: What technologies did you use? How did you break down and assign tasks and roles? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
* Demo: Show your stuff!
* Directions for future development.
* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.
